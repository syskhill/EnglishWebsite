title: My Academic Journey
---

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Connor, and this is where I share my journey through research, writing, and personal growth.

My academic adventure revolves around one key idea: **Generalization before specialization in childhood development**. As someone who experienced the highs and lows of early sports specialization, I've been fascinated by how diverse experiences in childhood can create stronger foundations for success later in life.

On this site, you'll find my research findings, personal stories, and reflections on how my writing and thinking have evolved throughout this semester. I've also included creative works like poetry and a speech that explore these themes in different formats. Whether you're interested in childhood development, academic writing, or just enjoy a good personal narrative, I hope you'll find something that resonates with you.

## What's New

I've recently added:
- A [poetry collection](/posts/poetry) exploring themes of balance and growth
- My [public speaking presentation](/posts/speech) on being a "Jack of All Trades"
- A [document library](/documents) with all original files for download
