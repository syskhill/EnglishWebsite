# Welcome to My Portfolio Blog

Hello! I'm Connor Cahill, and this blog documents my academic writing journey throughout the semester.

## About This Blog

This portfolio presents my evolution as a writer and researcher, showcasing:
- Research findings on childhood development
- Personal narratives and reflections
- The growth of my academic writing process

## Research Focus

My primary research focuses on **The benefits of generalization before specialization in childhood development**. Through this work, I explore how early exposure to diverse activities creates better foundations for later success than premature specialization.
