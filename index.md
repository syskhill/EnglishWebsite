# Welcome to My Academic Portfolio

*This content is based on information from various documents in the docs folder.*

Hello! I'm Connor Cahill, and this website documents my academic journey exploring the benefits of generalization before specialization in childhood development.

## About My Research

My work centers on understanding how early exposure to diverse activities creates stronger foundations for later success than premature specialization. This research combines scholarly investigation with my personal experience as a former competitive swimmer who experienced both the benefits and limitations of early specialization.

Through this portfolio, you'll find:

- **Research findings** on developmental patterns across athletic, academic, and artistic domains
- **Personal narratives** about my own experience with early specialization
- **Creative works** through poetry and speech

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope these resources contribute to conversations about childhood development and educational approaches that prioritize exploration before specialization.
