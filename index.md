# Welcome to My Academic Portfolio

Hi, I'm Connor Cahill. I’m a student, writer, and thinker using this site to explore one big idea: that *doing a lot of things can be just as valuable as specializing early*. This portfolio brings together my research, personal experiences, and creative work around how generalization shapes growth—especially during adolescence.

I’ve juggled soccer practice, robotics club, academic deadlines, and everything in between. That chaos didn’t just stress me out—it taught me how to adapt. Over time, I became curious about whether generalization might actually be an advantage, not a flaw. That curiosity turned into research.

## What I Research

My focus is on **the benefits of generalization before specialization** in childhood and adolescent development. I look at how trying many things—sports, clubs, creative work, academics—helps young people build skills that go beyond any single domain: adaptability, resilience, self-discovery.

This isn’t just an academic topic for me—it’s personal. I’ve lived the reality of balancing too many things at once and wondering whether I needed to commit to just one. That question drives everything I write here.

## What You’ll Find Here

This site is a space where I bring together research, reflection, and creativity. It’s part academic journal, part personal blog, and part creative outlet. Here’s what you can explore:

- **Research-Based Writing** — Essays, bibliographies, and original research exploring generalization, specialization, and developmental psychology  
- **Personal Narratives** — Stories about my own journey through high school and what I’ve learned from trying to do everything  
- **Creative Work** — Poetry, speeches, and fiction that bring research themes to life in new, unexpected ways  
- **Reflections** — Honest thoughts about balance, burnout, exploration, and identity  

## Why This Matters

We live in a culture that pressures young people to specialize early—to find “their thing” by middle school and stick with it. But that’s not how most lives work. Through this site, I’m making a case for exploration: for kids and teens to try, fail, switch paths, and figure out who they are along the way.

Thanks for being here. Whether you're a student, educator, or just someone thinking about how we grow up—I hope this portfolio gives you something to reflect on.
