## 5:45 A.M. Realities

“Time for another day,” I said to myself after hearing the alarm blaring at 5:45. I had 15 minutes to get ready before I got picked up to start my day off with a grueling lift that was “a refreshing start to my day,” as my coach would put it. The morning soccer lifts were considered optional—but if I wanted a shot at making my high school team’s varsity, I had to go. No time to think—just get ready.

“I’m outside,” the text read. Harry was a tad late, but I didn’t mind—it gave me a bit more time to pull myself together. I hopped into the car. The drive is always a blur on Tuesday and Thursday mornings—my brain half-asleep the entire ride.

## Weight Room Wake-Up

“Everyone lineup. It's time to stretch,” my coach would say at exactly 6:30, every single time we had our “optional” lift. The gym floor creaked like an old door hinge as we ran across it in our worn lifting shoes. After stretching, we finally got to head to our state-of-the-art weight room. For a high school, it was top-tier. Rows of benches and squat racks lined the royal blue walls. Today—leg day. Squats. Leg presses. And of course, abs. Always abs.

By 7:30, we were done. Time to shift gears and get ready for classes.

## First Period and Forgotten Pencils

“Yo man, what’s up,” said my friend Eric. We were good friends, and we shared first period on C days—which today was.

“Long lift this morning,” I replied.

It was stats class. Of course, I forgot a pencil. I always do.

> “Yo Eric, you mind if I grab a pencil?”

> “You really think I have one?”

> “You’re right. My bad for asking.”

This was routine. I got a pencil from the kid behind me—still don’t know his name.

Stats is bearable because Eric’s there, but the best part of school? Flex.

## Flex Time, Finally

At flex, we all had lunch together in the old cafeteria. That’s when I got to see the rest of the crew—Fox, Stuckamn, Beneder, and Byrum. Finally, a moment to breathe.

“How’s your day been so far, man?” Byrum asked.

“Long,” I always said. “I already had soccer lifting, and I’ve got club practice tonight after robotics.”

“I feel you,” he replied.

Joe was always in the same boat—club volleyball practice every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. He felt the same struggle I did: too much to do, not enough time to do it. But somehow, the days always flew by.
