# Midterm Reflection: My Evolution as a Writer

## Introduction

When I began this writing journey at the semester's start, I approached academic writing as something entirely separate from personal expression. Research papers belonged in one category—formal, distant, impersonal—while narrative writing occupied another—authentic but less "serious." The most significant transformation in my writing has been dissolving this artificial boundary.

## Key Developments in My Writing

### 1. Structural Intentionality

My early drafts often meandered, following trains of thought without clear direction. Through feedback and revision, I've learned to approach structure more deliberately:

- Beginning with outlining that connects to my thesis
- Using topic sentences that guide rather than just introduce
- Creating transitions that build arguments rather than merely shifting between topics

The difference is evident when comparing my first narrative draft with the current version of "5:45 A.M. Starts." The original read like a chronological report; the revision builds emotional resonance through purposeful scene selection and pacing.

### 2. Integration of Research and Personal Experience

Initially, I viewed citations as academic requirements rather than conversation partners. The breakthrough came while reading *Weaving Personal Experience into Academic Writing*, which presented research not as distant authority but as human inquiry I could engage with.

This perspective transformed how I approach source material:

- I now read for positions I can respond to rather than just facts to report
- My citations include contextual framing that connects to my larger argument
- I recognize how my personal experiences can both support and complicate research findings

In my research argument, this integration allows me to move beyond simply reporting studies on early specialization to engaging critically with their implications.

### 3. Critical Thinking Development

Perhaps the most profound change has been developing what *Looking for Trouble* calls "productive skepticism"—questioning not to dismiss but to deepen understanding.

Before, I tended toward either uncritical acceptance of published research or reflexive contrarianism. Now I'm learning to:

- Identify underlying assumptions in both my thinking and others'
- Consider contextual factors that might limit applicability of findings
- Recognize that complexity doesn't undermine validity but enriches it

This critical approach emerged while working on my annotated bibliography, where I began noticing patterns and contradictions across sources rather than treating each as isolated information.

## Influential Resources

Three readings have significantly shaped my development:

1. **Weaving Personal Experience into Academic Writing** — This essay legitimized the inclusion of my own experiences as valuable evidence when properly framed.

2. **Looking for Trouble** — This reading transformed how I approach complexity in research, helping me see that strong arguments acknowledge rather than simplify complications.

3. **Assessing Source Credibility** — This practical guide helped me move beyond superficial markers of authority to deeper assessment of methodology and evidence.

## Areas for Continued Growth

As I move into the semester's second half, I'm focusing on three specific areas:

1. **Revision Depth** — I still tend to edit primarily at sentence level rather than reconsidering larger structural elements.

2. **Research Integration** — While improving, my incorporation of sources can still feel mechanical rather than conversational.

3. **Audience Awareness** — I need to more consistently consider how readers might respond to or use my arguments.

## Conclusion

The most valuable insight from this semester has been recognizing that effective academic writing isn't about removing myself from the text but about engaging more thoughtfully—with sources, with readers, and with my own experiences and perspectives.

This evolution isn't just making me a better writer for academic purposes; it's helping me think more clearly about complex issues in all areas of life. I'm learning that good writing isn't about following rules but about creating meaningful connections—between ideas, between research and reality, and between writer and reader.
