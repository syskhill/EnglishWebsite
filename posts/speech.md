## How Many of You Have Been Asked...

“How many of you have been asked, ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ And how many of you had no idea what to say?”

Yeah. Same.

We live in a world obsessed with picking one thing. One sport. One major. One job. One path. But being a generalist—someone who dabbles in lots of different things—isn’t a weakness. It’s a superpower.

## My Life Was Chaos—And That Was a Good Thing

When I was grinding through early-morning soccer lifts, rushing to class without a pencil, juggling club practice and robotics meetings, it felt chaotic. But looking back? That chaos built more skills than I ever realized. Teamwork, time management, learning to switch gears fast—it wasn’t just a busy schedule, it was training for adaptability.

And adaptability is everything.

## The Research Backs It Up

Studies agree. Research from the National Library of Medicine found that kids who try different sports have better coordination, fewer injuries, and stick with athletics longer. Median published a piece showing that child prodigies—those who specialize early—struggle more later because they’re not used to switching paths or handling failure.

Psychologists describe “open vs. closed environments.” The real world is open. There are no step-by-step guides. You have to figure things out on the fly. Generalists thrive in that space. Specialists? Not always.

## Famous Late Bloomers

Even Forbes weighed in: many successful people didn’t find their “thing” right away.

- Steve Jobs studied calligraphy.
- Maya Angelou was a dancer, fry cook, and journalist before writing.
- Serena Williams played multiple sports before focusing on tennis.

Being great at just one thing? Overrated.

## Try Everything. Fail Often.

Here’s the truth: you don’t have to have everything figured out right now. In fact, you shouldn’t.

Try new clubs. Take weird electives. Fail at stuff. Learn what doesn’t work just as much as what does.

Being a generalist doesn’t mean you’re average at everything. It means your foundation is wide enough to grow in any direction.

## Final Thought

So if you’re into robotics and art, science and poetry, soccer and strategy games—good. Keep going. That mix might be exactly what sets you apart one day.

Because in a world that keeps telling you to pick one lane, being good at a lot of things might just be the smartest move you ever make.

Thanks.
