## The Path Between

They say to pick a lane,  
One goal, one dream, one game.  
But what if I don’t want to choose?  
What if picking means I lose?

A kid who paints, who runs, who plays,  
Who builds, explores, and shifts their ways.  
They’re told to focus, stick to one,  
But what if switching makes it fun?

Some rise fast, they shine real bright,  
A single skill, their guiding light.  
Mozart’s keys, an athlete’s grind,  
A narrow path, a single mind.

But others roam, their interests wide,  
Da Vinci’s hands refused to hide.  
A mind that tests, that jumps between,  
Finds skills in places yet unseen.

A specialist hones, sharp as steel,  
Perfects their craft, refines their feel.  
But those who mix, adapt, explore,  
Can shift when life throws something more.

Studies say let children play,  
Try it all, find their way.  
Because a box can lock them in,  
But open doors help dreams begin.

One kid drills a single move,  
Another learns to switch and groove.  
And when the game begins to change,  
Who’s more ready to rearrange?

Not all must lock a single door,  
Not all success is one route more.  
Some who blend, who shift, who see,  
Find ways that specialists let be.

So let them wander, let them roam,  
Let them shape what they call home.  
Because life isn’t just one lane,  
It’s all the roads we learn to name.

## Sharpen the Blade

One craft, one flame, one steady hand,  
A single tool shaped by demand.  
While others drift from path to path,  
Some choose the forge, endure the wrath.

A violinist finds her tune,  
By playing morning, night, and noon.  
Each note refined, each motion small,  
Becomes a symphony through it all.

The surgeon’s cut, precise and clean,  
Was not a gift, but daily gleaned.  
Through practice sharp and endless drill,  
Comes the miracle of skill.

A master knows what time can do—  
How focus draws the rarest view.  
What others glimpse, they understand,  
Like reading braille with practiced hands.

To specialize is not to shrink,  
But dive so deep you start to think  
In languages that few can speak,  
Where expertise and vision meet.

So when you find the thing you love,  
Go further than the stars above.  
For sometimes life rewards the one  
Who sharpens more than anyone.

## Reflections on the Poems

These two poems offer contrasting yet complementary perspectives on how we choose to grow.

**“The Path Between”** is a celebration of curiosity, variety, and flexibility. It speaks to those who fear being boxed in or forced to give up parts of themselves in pursuit of a single identity. The poem champions generalists—the learners, tinkerers, and creative minds who shape their futures by exploring widely. It acknowledges the tension of growing up in a world that values focus but gently reminds us that exploring multiple paths is itself a valid journey.

**“Sharpen the Blade”** serves as a powerful tribute to the beauty and discipline of deep focus. It honors the specialist—the one who drills, refines, and commits wholeheartedly to one pursuit. It reminds us that mastery is not random, but the result of deliberate repetition, resilience, and time. It doesn’t oppose exploration; rather, it highlights the transformation that occurs when passion and persistence align.

Together, these poems don’t argue one side is better—they argue both are necessary. The world needs specialists and generalists, deep roots and wide branches. These poems are two sides of the same coin: how we discover what we’re meant to do, and how we grow into it, one choice at a time.
