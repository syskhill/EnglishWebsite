## Why I Chose This Topic

For my original research, I decided to explore how generalizing—doing multiple sports, clubs, and activities—impacts students in high school. I was drawn to this topic because of my own experience balancing soccer, robotics, schoolwork, and other commitments. I’ve always wondered whether doing a lot helped me grow, or if I would’ve been better off narrowing my focus.

To dig deeper into this question, I chose to interview a former high school student who had a wide range of involvement: National Honor Society, Key Club, Soccer Team, Swim Team, and Baseball Team.

## Why I Chose an Interview

I decided to use an interview as my research method because I wanted to capture detailed personal insights that wouldn’t show up in a simple survey. During our conversation, the interviewee shared that they never felt pressured to specialize and actually preferred trying new things.

They said generalizing:

- Helped them form more friendships  
- Exposed them to a wider range of experiences  
- Made them quicker at learning new skills  

## What I Learned

One of the most striking insights was how generalizing kept them excited and motivated. It prevented burnout and made their high school years more enjoyable. But it wasn’t just about skill-building—it was emotional growth, too. Generalizing taught them:

- How to deal with failure  
- How to manage expectations  
- How to adapt when feeling unprepared or inexperienced  

When I asked if they would change anything, they said they wouldn’t have specialized earlier. In fact, they wished they had done even more.

Their advice to underclassmen was simple and powerful:  
> “Don’t [specialize]—you’ll lose.”

They strongly believe that schools and coaches pressure students to specialize too soon, which limits their growth and experiences.

## Final Reflection

This interview reinforced what I’ve been learning through academic research: that generalization builds adaptability, resilience, and confidence. But more importantly, it showed me the power of real-world stories when it comes to understanding abstract concepts.

This process helped me connect personal reflection with academic research in a way that made my argument stronger—and more meaningful.
