## My Experience with Generalization

Throughout high school, I balanced soccer, robotics, chess, and community service. I was never the best at any single one, and I often questioned if that made my efforts less meaningful. However, research reveals that generalization during childhood builds adaptable, empathetic leaders.

## Long-Term Advantages of Being a Generalist

Generalization offers long-term benefits. As researchers Côté and Vierimaa explain:

> “Risks of early sports specialization include higher rates of injury, increased psychological stress, and quitting sports at a young age.”  
> — *National Library of Medicine*

This suggests that a varied childhood builds not only physical resilience, but also a foundation for lasting success.

Generalists also develop stronger self-identity. According to a Medium article:

> “Kids have to try a lot of things before they find something they’re truly good at.”  
> — *@MyBizKidMBK*

My range of activities helped me understand who I was beyond a single role. It broadened my insights and made me more compassionate.

## Generalization Builds Empathy and Flexibility

Being a generalist fosters empathy and flexible thinking. A study in *BMC Psychology* found:

> “Those raised in open environments were more likely to exhibit flexible thinking, greater empathy, and a broader understanding of social dynamics.”  
> — *Zhang et al.*

This matches my experience. I learned to work with diverse groups across different clubs and activities.

Generalists act as connectors. The *Kurzgesagt* video put it well:

> “Generalists thrive in environments that demand flexibility, creativity, and collaboration. They often become the bridges between specialists.”

I often found myself linking different friend groups and teams—an ability that came naturally from participating in a variety of communities.

## Final Thoughts

In hindsight, being a generalist didn’t limit me—it empowered me. I became someone who can adapt, connect, and lead across contexts. Adolescents should be encouraged to explore broadly. It shapes stronger, more capable individuals.
