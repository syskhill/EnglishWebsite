# Hey, I'm Connor! üëã

![Profile Photo](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Student by day, researcher by night, and former competitive swimmer with a story to tell.

## My Story

Picture this: 5:45 AM swim practices, chlorine-scented afternoons, and a schedule so packed that "free time" seemed like a foreign concept. That was my childhood as a specialized athlete.

Don't get me wrong ‚Äì swimming taught me discipline, perseverance, and how to rock some seriously weird tan lines. But it also led me to wonder: *What else might I have discovered if I hadn't devoted all those early years to just one activity?*

That question sparked my current academic obsession: **studying the benefits of generalization before specialization in childhood development**.

## What This Blog Is About

This isn't your typical academic portfolio. It's more like an unfiltered look at my journey from:

- üèä A kid who only knew the inside of a pool
- üìù To a writer finding their voice
- üîç To a researcher asking questions that matter

Through this site, I'm:

- **Documenting my evolution** from telling personal stories to crafting research-based arguments
- **Sharing my findings** on why kids might benefit from trying lots of things before going all-in on one
- **Connecting the dots** between my own experiences and what the research shows
- **Starting conversations** with others who care about these topics

## My Approach to Writing

I believe academic writing doesn't have to be boring. My goal is to keep things:

- **Authentic** - Real voice, real experiences
- **Critical** - Not just accepting what I read, but questioning it
- **Reflective** - Constantly looking back to move forward
- **Accessible** - Because what's the point of research if no one can understand it?
