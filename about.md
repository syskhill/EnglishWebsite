# About Me

## Hey, I'm Connor Cahill

I'm a student, writer, and curious learner navigating the overlap between real-life experience and academic research. This site is where I bring together the different parts of who I am—someone who's lived the grind of early specialization, but also someone who’s found new meaning in asking “what if I had done things differently?”

Growing up, I was the early riser in the pool—competitive swimming, strict schedules, chasing times. For a while, that was my whole identity. But the further I got into it, the more I wondered: *Was specializing so young actually helping me?* That question launched me into research about generalization in childhood—trying many things before picking just one—and how that can shape healthier, more resilient lives.

## What I’m Researching

I focus on **the benefits of generalization before specialization in childhood development**. That means looking at how kids who try different sports, hobbies, and academic interests early on tend to grow into more adaptable, creative, and well-rounded adults.

What makes my research different is that it's deeply personal. I'm not just reading articles and quoting stats—I'm connecting those ideas to real experiences from my own life and the lives of people around me. Whether it’s a fictional character like Milo or a real conversation with a friend, I’m exploring what it means to *not* fit into one box too early.

## What This Site Is

This site is my digital notebook, writing studio, and research archive all in one. Here’s what you’ll find:

- 🧠 **Research Projects** — Academic writing that digs into childhood development and learning psychology  
- ✍️ **Narratives & Fiction** — Personal and fictional stories that give voice to the themes I study  
- 📚 **Poetry & Speeches** — Creative work that explores identity, growth, and education in new ways  
- 🔍 **Reflections** — Posts that show how I connect new ideas with lived experience  

It’s part portfolio, part process, and always evolving.

## How I Write

I try to keep my writing honest and engaging. Even when I’m working with complex research, I want the language to feel human and clear. You’ll see that I often bring in personal anecdotes, rhetorical questions, and a conversational tone—because I think academic work can be both rigorous *and* readable.

My style blends:

- **Authenticity** — I don’t pretend to be an expert. I share what I’m learning as I go.  
- **Curiosity** — I ask a lot of “what if” questions and love following ideas down rabbit holes.  
- **Reflection** — I try to connect every new concept to something real in my life.  
- **Clarity** — I want people from any background to be able to engage with what I’m writing.
